Copy the .github directory into existing projects or create a new repo using this one as a template to be able to use Issue and Pull request templates.

Test to confirm that it is .github/pull_request_template.md and not .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md that is used by default in PRs.
