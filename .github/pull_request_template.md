## Libraries

> While not required, it is helpful if the Library name is a link to the library's repository, and the library's minimum and/or maximum version is a link to the specific release or release candidate's tag. The text of the link to the tag should probably be the release/release candidate's title, while the href should refer to the tag. This is because the tag will always need to have a v in it, but the title should reserve including the v in the title for when a release candidate has been finalized as a release. Seeing a v in the text of the version link will indicate that the library is a release and not a release candidate.
