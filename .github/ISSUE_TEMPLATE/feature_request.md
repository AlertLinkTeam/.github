>> <summary><strong>Tip:</strong> Selecting Lines of Code</summary>
>>
>> To insert a section of code, including line numbers into this issue, in another tab, open up the file in question and click on a line number. If there are multiple lines of code, press `<ctrl>`+`<shift>` and click on the last line number in the range. This will change the URL in the address bar to a range of line numbers, with the selection anchored to those lines. Is is safer to link to the lines of code themselves, incase a change is committed after this reference is made that would change the line numbers. To do this, after selecting the range of lines as previously described, and then press `<y>`. This should insert a hash into the url. Copy and paste the url from the address bar to this issue.

>> <summary><strong>Tip:</strong> Change Formatting</summary>
>>
>> To specify the change, you can use a fenced code block (using the \`\`\` notation) and specify `diff` for the language. You can prefix the lines of code with `-` and `+` to indicate the code that should be removed or added.  
>> __Ex:__ <br />
>>> \> \`\`\`diff <br />
>>> \> \- System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Hello World"); <br />
>>> \> \+ System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Goodbye World"); <br />
>>> \> \`\`\` <br />
>>
>> __Yields:__ <br />
>>> ```diff
>>> - System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Hello World");
>>> + System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Goodbye World");
>>> ```
